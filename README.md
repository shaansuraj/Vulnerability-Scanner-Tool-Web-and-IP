# Vulnerability Scanner

The Vulnerability Scanner is a Java application designed to help users identify potential security vulnerabilities in both network services and web applications. It offers a user-friendly graphical interface for easy interaction and provides detailed information about detected vulnerabilities.

## Features

- **Host Scanning:** Scan a target host for open ports and identify the services running on those ports.
- **Web Application Scanning:** Perform security checks on web applications, including detecting outdated libraries, unvalidated redirects, and insecure direct object references.
- **Vulnerability Database:** Maintain a database of known vulnerabilities for common services and libraries.
- **Customizable Port Range:** Set a custom range of ports to scan for network services.
- **Report Generation:** Save scan results to a file for future reference.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive graphical interface with status updates and options for canceling scans.
